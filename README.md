Solutions to the problems at ProjectEuler.net

SPOILER ALERT!
--------------

I recommend that everyone attempt to solve these problems on their own before
viewing the solutions here.  This repository is for the sharing and comparison
of solutions.

###INSTRUCTIONS

Currently, all solutions are inside the python package 'solutions'.  To run a 
solution for problem x use `python -m solutions.Problem<x>.solve` from
the root of the repository

###Note: 
Some solutions use the utils.primes module and may require a
'primes' file in the working directory.  If this file is not present, the
primes module will generate it automatically.  Currently it will generate all
primes less than 2,000,000.  This will only take maybe a few seconds on modern
systems and uses around 12 MB of space.
