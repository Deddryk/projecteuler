Problem 31
==========

In England the currency is made up of pound, and pence, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

   1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 50p, 100p and 200p.

It is possible to make 200p in the following way:

   1*100p + 1*50p + 2*20p + 1*5p + 1*2p + 3*1p

How many different ways can 200p be made using any number of coins?
